*This post has an update: [The Cat API has returned, kind of](/blog/cat-api-back)*

I wanted to launch my new static site, procrastinated because of the Cat API, and then got notified that it posed a safety risk to me, so I just nuked the old site and switched to this new one. I'll remake the API with the flaw fixed when I have the time and energy to do so.
