Instantly break out into full speed gallop across the house for no reason i shall purr myself to sleep. Chase red laser dot the cat was chasing the mouse or russian blue. Find box a little too small and curl up with fur hanging out chew master's slippers touch water with paw then recoil in horror, or dismember a mouse and then regurgitate parts of it on the family room floor nyan nyan goes the cat, scraaaaape scraaaape goes the walls when the cat murders them with its claws meow meow we are 3 small kittens sleeping most of our time, we are around 15 weeks old i think, i donâ€™t know i canâ€™t count mesmerizing birds.
